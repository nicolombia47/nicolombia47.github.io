  <p>In addition to threats like malware and phishing, insecure networks are an equally prevelant threat. Public Wi-Fi networks, while convenient, are also at times very dangerous and risky. Public Internet connections are used by malicous actors to exploit unsespecting users and access devices to steal information. These kinds of criminals instercept data that is transmited over their connections, aiming to find seneitive information. This data, is then used to either exploit users financially and steal from their bank accounts, or to use the personal data stolen to commit identity theft. Proactive measures can be implemented however. The best way to protect agaisnt insecure networks, is to use a VPN, or virtual private network. These softwares encrypt internet traffic being sent or received by your deviced. Using these softwares can help protect agaisnt these attacks, and make a safer experience on the internet for all.
