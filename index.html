    <h1>A Breif Hisotry of the Internet</h1>
    <p> The start of the internet can be traced to a government program in the 1960's as a way to share information among researchers. At the time it was developement, the only way to access information stored on a computer was to visit the computer physically, or thorugh mailing magnetic tapes. With the cold war ongoing, the United States was reseraches ways to send and receive information that could withstand a nuclear attack. This lead to the creation of the Advanced Research Project Agency Network or ARPANET. The goal of the ARPANET was to allow computers to share information and resources by connecting them through telephone lines. ARPANET was a huge success, but very limited in those who could use it, with it being only those with contracts from the defense deprartment. Because of this, other similar netwroks began to be developed. 
    <p> A new communications protocal called Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP was developed. This new system worked where IP contained the adress and TCP sent and received the information according the IP adresses. This new system was quickly adapted by ARPANET on January 1st, 1983, which is now considered the day the internet was born. With the establishment and implementation of these new protocols in the 1980's communication between computers became more efficiant and reliable. This laid the groundwork for the future development of the internet as technolgoy evlovled and it moved from academics and military to commercial use. This age of development and adaptation set the stage for the exponential growth that came in the following year. This government program, which inspired the development of standardized internet protocols TSP/IP, and the implementaions of these new protocols allowed for incredible growth in the internet over the next coming years. 
    <p> In the 1990's the internet began to explode from a niche tool into a widley spread tool to be used by all. This came along with the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, a user-friendly interface that allowed the individual person easy and convenient access to the internet. The ease of use was increased even further by web browsers like mosiac and netscape navigator. Because of this, the usage of the internet increased dramatically into as millions of people flooded to internet to access its endless information. This ultimately lead to the "dot-com" boom, where the industry grew rapidly as many startups received tremendous funding. E-commerce specifically saw great growth, starting the tech giant that is now Amazon, as well as many others. By the end of the decade the internet became so wide spread that it was for many, a part of every day life, its usages spread to communication, media, and social interactions. Since then it has grown to be an integral part in todays society, and something that many people say they could not live without.
